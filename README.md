# Ball Knower - NFL Betting Analytics

A leak-free, modular NFL spread prediction system that combines EPA analysis, power ratings, and machine learning to find value in betting markets.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Build a reliable NFL spread prediction system that:
- Produces deterministic baseline spreads (v1.0)
- Enhances with structural features (v1.1)
- Applies ML correction layer (v1.2)
- Identifies value bets vs Vegas lines
- Provides ROI analysis for bet sizing

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **COMPLETE - Core System Built**

- Team name normalization (handles all data sources)
- Data loaders for nfelo, Substack, and nfl_data_py
- Leak-free feature engineering framework
- v1.0 deterministic spread model
- v1.2 ML correction layer
- Backtest and ROI analysis functions
- Demo notebook with Week 11, 2025 predictions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Demo Notebook

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nfl_data_py jupyter

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook notebooks/ball_knower_demo.ipynb
```

The demo notebook will:
1. Load your Week 11, 2025 data (nfelo + Substack)
2. Merge all team ratings
3. Generate spread predictions with v1.0 model
4. Identify value bets vs Vegas lines

### Run Tests

```bash
python test_data_loading.py
```

This validates that all data files load correctly with proper team name normalization.

## 📈 Data Sources

### Current Week Data (Week 11, 2025)

**nfelo files** (`data/current_season/`):
- `nfelo_power_ratings_2025_week_11.csv` - ELO ratings, QB adjustments
- `nfelo_epa_tiers_off_def_2025_week_11.csv` - EPA per play (offense/defense)
- `nfelo_strength_of_schedule_2025_week_11.csv` - SOS metrics
- `nfelo_qb_rankings_2025_week_11.csv` - QB performance rankings

**Substack files** (`data/current_season/`):
- `substack_power_ratings_2025_week_11.csv` - Offensive/Defensive/Overall ratings
- `substack_qb_epa_2025_week_11.csv` - QB-level EPA data
- `substack_weekly_proj_ppg_2025_week_11.csv` - Game projections & spreads

**Reference data** (`data/reference/`):
- `nfl_head_coaches.csv` - Coach stats and tenure
- `nfl_AV_data_through_2024.xlsx` - Approximate Value through 2024

### Historical Data

Historical game data (schedules, scores, Vegas lines) is loaded from **nfl_data_py**:
- Covers 1999-2024 seasons
- Includes spreads, totals, weather, stadium info
- Used for backtesting and feature engineering

## 🔧 How It Works

### Model Progression

**v1.0 - Deterministic Baseline**
- EPA differential × 100 → point spread contribution
- nfelo differential × 0.04 → point spread contribution
- Substack overall rating differential
- Home field advantage (2.5 points)
- **No ML, just weighted combination**

**v1.1 - Enhanced Features** (not yet implemented)
- Adds: rest advantage, recent form, QB adjustments
- Still deterministic, no training required

**v1.2 - ML Correction**
- Small Ridge regression layer on top of v1.1
- Learns residual corrections from historical games
- Captures nonlinear effects v1.1 misses

### Spread Convention

All spreads are from **HOME TEAM perspective**:
- **Negative** = home team favored (e.g., -3 means home by 3)
- **Positive** = home team underdog (e.g., +3 means away by 3)

### Edge Calculation

```
Edge = Ball Knower Prediction - Vegas Line
```

- **Negative edge**: Model likes home team more than Vegas → bet home
- **Positive edge**: Model likes away team more than Vegas → bet away
- Only bet when `|Edge| >= 0.5 points` (configurable)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Leakage Prevention

All features are **strictly leak-free**:
- Rolling averages use `.shift(1)` to exclude current game
- No future information in any feature
- Date-based validation ensures proper time ordering

### Data Integrity

Team name normalization handles all variations:
- nfelo: `LAR`, `KC`, `BUF`
- Substack power: `Rams`, `Chiefs`, `Bills`
- Substack QB: `ram`, `kan`, `buf` (lowercase)
- Substack weekly: `Los Angeles Rams`, `Kansas City Chiefs`

All map to nfl_data_py standard: `LAR`, `KC`, `BUF`

## 📊 Next Steps

### To Build Full Backtest System:

1. **Load historical schedules** (2015-2024)
   ```python
   from src import data_loader
   schedules = data_loader.load_historical_schedules(2015, 2024)
   ```

2. **Engineer features** (leak-free rolling EPA)
   ```python
   from src import features
   schedules_with_features = features.engineer_all_features(schedules, weekly_stats)
   ```

3. **Train v1.2 model**
   ```python
   from src import models
   model = models.MLCorrectionModel()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Backtest across seasons**
   ```python
   metrics = models.backtest_model(model, train_df, test_df)
   ```

5. **Analyze ROI by edge bin**
   ```python
   roi_df = models.calculate_roi_by_edge(actuals, predictions, vegas, edge_bins=[0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5])
   ```

### To Run Weekly Predictions:

1. Download latest CSVs from nfelo and Substack
2. Update `CURRENT_WEEK` in `src/config.py`
3. Replace files in `data/current_season/`
4. Run `notebooks/ball_knower_demo.ipynb`
5. Compare predictions to Bovada lines
6. Bet where edge exists!

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Data Availability

- nfelo/Substack data only available for current week (Week 11, 2025)
- Historical ratings from these sources not available
- **Solution**: Build v1.0-v1.2 using nfl_data_py historical EPA data first, then layer in external ratings for current week predictions

### Model Status

- ✅ v1.0 baseline complete and tested
- ⚠️ v1.1 enhanced features - framework built, needs implementation
- ⚠️ v1.2 ML correction - code written, needs training on historical data
- ⚠️ Backtesting - needs historical feature engineering completed

### Data Quirks

- Substack files have 2-row headers (handled)
- Some matchups use "at", some use "vs" (handled)
- QBs with multiple teams like "cle, cin" (take first team)
- File naming: `nfelo_nfl_win_totals_2025_week_11 (1).csv` (duplicate upload?)

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Deterministic Baseline First?

Previous attempts with ChatGPT/Gemini failed because they jumped straight to complex ML without a solid foundation. The deterministic v1.0:
- Forces us to understand what actually predicts spreads
- Provides interpretable baseline for comparison
- Catches data issues early (garbage in = garbage out)
- Often performs surprisingly well (simplicity is underrated)

### Why Not Just Use ML?

Pure ML models tend to:
- Overfit on noise rather than signal
- Fail to generalize across seasons/rule changes
- Lack interpretability (can't explain why)
- Struggle with small data (16-17 games/season/team)

Our hybrid approach:
- Deterministic core (domain knowledge)
- Small ML layer (capture residual patterns)
- Best of both worlds

### Why Leak Prevention is Critical

A single leaked feature (e.g., using same-week EPA instead of past EPA) can:
- Make backtest look amazing
- Completely fail in live betting
- Waste months of work

We validate every feature to prevent this.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal betting system, but the code structure follows best practices:

- **Modular**: Each file has single responsibility
- **Tested**: Data loading validated with actual files
- **Documented**: Every function has docstrings
- **Type-safe**: Sensible parameter types
- **DRY**: Single config file, no duplicates

## 📝 Lessons from Previous Attempts

### What Failed Before (ChatGPT/Gemini):

1. Multiple conflicting config blocks
2. Team name mismatches in merges
3. Leakage in rolling stats
4. Week alignment errors
5. Variables referenced before definition
6. Over-reliance on notebook state

### What We Fixed:

1. ✅ Single `config.py` file
2. ✅ Comprehensive team name mapping
3. ✅ `.shift(1)` in all rolling calculations
4. ✅ Deterministic, testable code
5. ✅ Proper module imports
6. ✅ Fresh execution from source
