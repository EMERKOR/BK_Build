# Ball Knower - NFL Betting Analytics

A leak-free, modular NFL spread prediction system that combines EPA analysis, power ratings, and machine learning to find value in betting markets.

## Project Goals

Build a reliable NFL spread prediction system that:
- Produces deterministic baseline spreads (v1.0)
- Enhances with structural features (v1.1)
- Applies ML correction layer (v1.2)
- Identifies value bets vs Vegas lines
- Provides ROI analysis for bet sizing

## Current Status

**COMPLETE - Core System Built**

- Team name normalization (handles all data sources)
- Data loaders for nfelo, Substack, and nfl_data_py
- Leak-free feature engineering framework
- v1.0 deterministic spread model
- v1.2 ML correction layer
- Backtest and ROI analysis functions
- Demo notebook with Week 11, 2025 predictions

## Quick Start

### Run the Demo Notebook

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nfl_data_py jupyter

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook notebooks/ball_knower_demo.ipynb
```

The demo notebook will:
1. Load your Week 11, 2025 data (nfelo + Substack)
2. Merge all team ratings
3. Generate spread predictions with v1.0 model
4. Identify value bets vs Vegas lines

### Run Tests

```bash
python test_data_loading.py
```

This validates that all data files load correctly with proper team name normalization.

## Modeling Documentation

**Important:** Before making changes to modeling or training code, review these documents:

- **[MODEL_OVERVIEW.md](docs/MODEL_OVERVIEW.md)** - Comprehensive audit of all existing model scripts, including what they predict, how they're evaluated, and where Vegas lines enter the system. Identifies objective misalignment issues in current v1.2.

- **[BALL_KNOWER_MODELING_PLAN.md](docs/BALL_KNOWER_MODELING_PLAN.md)** - Forward-looking design document that defines modeling objectives, versioned roadmap (v1.0 through v2.0), principles/guardrails, and success metrics. This is the design contract for future modeling work.

**Key Insight from Audit:**
Current v1.2 trains to predict Vegas closing lines rather than actual game outcomes. This makes "edges" a measure of disagreement with Vegas (often model error) rather than genuine football insight. Future modeling phases should target actual game margins or cover outcomes, using Vegas as context rather than the training target.

## Data Sources

### Current Week Data (Week 11, 2025)

**nfelo files** (`data/current_season/`):
- `power_ratings_nfelo_2025_week_11.csv` - ELO ratings, QB adjustments
- `epa_tiers_nfelo_2025_week_11.csv` - EPA per play (offense/defense)
- `strength_of_schedule_nfelo_2025_week_11.csv` - SOS metrics
- `nfelo_qb_rankings_2025_week_11.csv` - QB performance rankings (reference)

**Substack files** (`data/current_season/`):
- `power_ratings_substack_2025_week_11.csv` - Offensive/Defensive/Overall ratings
- `qb_epa_substack_2025_week_11.csv` - QB-level EPA data
- `weekly_projections_ppg_substack_2025_week_11.csv` - Game projections & spreads

**Reference data** (`data/reference/`):
- `nfl_head_coaches.csv` - Coach stats and tenure
- `nfl_AV_data_through_2024.xlsx` - Approximate Value through 2024

### Historical Data

Historical game data (schedules, scores, Vegas lines) is loaded from **nfl_data_py**:
- Covers 1999-2024 seasons
- Includes spreads, totals, weather, stadium info
- Used for backtesting and feature engineering

## 🔧 How It Works

### Model Progression

**v1.0 - Deterministic Baseline**
- EPA differential × 100 → point spread contribution
- nfelo differential × 0.04 → point spread contribution
- Substack overall rating differential
- Home field advantage (2.5 points)
- **No ML, just weighted combination**

**v1.1 - Enhanced Features** (not yet implemented)
- Adds: rest advantage, recent form, QB adjustments
- Still deterministic, no training required

**v1.2 - ML Correction**
- Small Ridge regression layer on top of v1.1
- Learns residual corrections from historical games
- Captures nonlinear effects v1.1 misses

### Spread Convention

All spreads are from **HOME TEAM perspective**:
- **Negative** = home team favored (e.g., -3 means home by 3)
- **Positive** = home team underdog (e.g., +3 means away by 3)

### Edge Calculation

```
Edge = Ball Knower Prediction - Vegas Line
```

- **Negative edge**: Model likes home team more than Vegas → bet home
- **Positive edge**: Model likes away team more than Vegas → bet away
- Only bet when `|Edge| >= 0.5 points` (configurable)

## Testing & Validation

### Leakage Prevention

All features are **strictly leak-free**:
- Rolling averages use `.shift(1)` to exclude current game
- No future information in any feature
- Date-based validation ensures proper time ordering

### Data Integrity

Team name normalization handles all variations:
- nfelo: `LAR`, `KC`, `BUF`
- Substack power: `Rams`, `Chiefs`, `Bills`
- Substack QB: `ram`, `kan`, `buf` (lowercase)
- Substack weekly: `Los Angeles Rams`, `Kansas City Chiefs`

All map to nfl_data_py standard: `LAR`, `KC`, `BUF`

## 📊 Next Steps

### To Build Full Backtest System:

1. **Load historical schedules** (2015-2024)
   ```python
   from src import data_loader
   schedules = data_loader.load_historical_schedules(2015, 2024)
   ```

2. **Engineer features** (leak-free rolling EPA)
   ```python
   from src import features
   schedules_with_features = features.engineer_all_features(schedules, weekly_stats)
   ```

3. **Train v1.2 model**
   ```python
   from src import models
   model = models.MLCorrectionModel()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Backtest across seasons**
   ```python
   metrics = models.backtest_model(model, train_df, test_df)
   ```

5. **Analyze ROI by edge bin**
   ```python
   roi_df = models.calculate_roi_by_edge(actuals, predictions, vegas, edge_bins=[0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5])
   ```

### To Run Weekly Predictions:

1. Download latest CSVs from nfelo and Substack
2. Update `CURRENT_WEEK` in `src/config.py`
3. Replace files in `data/current_season/`
4. Run `notebooks/ball_knower_demo.ipynb`
5. Compare predictions to Bovada lines
6. Bet where edge exists!

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Data Availability

- nfelo/Substack data only available for current week (Week 11, 2025)
- Historical ratings from these sources not available
- **Solution**: Build v1.0-v1.2 using nfl_data_py historical EPA data first, then layer in external ratings for current week predictions

### Model Status

- v1.0 baseline complete and tested
- v1.1 enhanced features - framework built, needs implementation
- v1.2 ML correction - code written, needs training on historical data
- Backtesting - needs historical feature engineering completed

### Data Quirks

- Substack files have 2-row headers (handled)
- Some matchups use "at", some use "vs" (handled)
- QBs with multiple teams like "cle, cin" (take first team)
- File naming: `nfelo_nfl_win_totals_2025_week_11 (1).csv` (duplicate upload?)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Deterministic Baseline First?

Previous attempts with ChatGPT/Gemini failed because they jumped straight to complex ML without a solid foundation. The deterministic v1.0:
- Forces us to understand what actually predicts spreads
- Provides interpretable baseline for comparison
- Catches data issues early (garbage in = garbage out)
- Often performs surprisingly well (simplicity is underrated)

### Why Not Just Use ML?

Pure ML models tend to:
- Overfit on noise rather than signal
- Fail to generalize across seasons/rule changes
- Lack interpretability (can't explain why)
- Struggle with small data (16-17 games/season/team)

Our hybrid approach:
- Deterministic core (domain knowledge)
- Small ML layer (capture residual patterns)
- Best of both worlds

### Why Leak Prevention is Critical

A single leaked feature (e.g., using same-week EPA instead of past EPA) can:
- Make backtest look amazing
- Completely fail in live betting
- Waste months of work

We validate every feature to prevent this.

## Contributing

This is a personal betting system, but the code structure follows best practices:

- **Modular**: Each file has single responsibility
- **Tested**: Data loading validated with actual files
- **Documented**: Every function has docstrings
- **Type-safe**: Sensible parameter types
- **DRY**: Single config file, no duplicates

## Lessons from Previous Attempts

### What Failed Before (ChatGPT/Gemini):

1. Multiple conflicting config blocks
2. Team name mismatches in merges
3. Leakage in rolling stats
4. Week alignment errors
5. Variables referenced before definition
6. Over-reliance on notebook state

### What We Fixed:

1. Single `config.py` file
2. Comprehensive team name mapping
3. `.shift(1)` in all rolling calculations
4. Deterministic, testable code
5. Proper module imports
6. Fresh execution from source
