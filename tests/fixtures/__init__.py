Test fixtures for Ball Knower

This module contains synthetic, minimal CSV and Parquet fixtures
for testing data loaders and dataset builders without requiring
real NFL data.

All fixtures are intentionally small (3-6 rows) and use fake team
names (TeamA, TeamB, TeamC) to ensure tests are self-contained
and portable.
