**Strategy**: Favorites 5+ Edge (54.6% validated win rate on 306 bets, 2020-2024)

**Phase**: Paper Trading (DO NOT BET REAL MONEY)

**Goal**: Validate strategy works in 2025 before risking capital

---

## Tracking Rules

### What to Track
1. **Every pick** generated by the strategy
2. **Actual outcomes** after games complete
3. **Running totals** (wins, losses, units, ROI)

### How to Track
1. Run `generate_weekly_picks_2025.py --week N` each week
2. Record picks in table below BEFORE games start
3. Update results after games complete
4. Calculate running totals

### Decision Points
- **After Week 4**: If win rate < 52%, pause and reassess
- **After Week 4**: If win rate ≥ 55%, consider small stakes (Week 5+)
- **Stop-loss**: If down >10 units at any point, pause

## Strategy Reminder

### What We're Betting
- **Only favorites** when model has ≥5 point edge
- Model must say "favorite should win by MORE than Vegas thinks"
- Typical volume: 1-2 bets per week

### Why It Works (Theory)
- Vegas overadjusts favorites due to public betting
- Creates underpriced favorites
- Model identifies these specific cases

### Validated Performance (2020-2024)
- 306 bets total
- 54.6% win rate
- +4.6% ROI
- Consistent across 4 years

### Risk Factors
1. **Small edge**: Only 2.2% above vig threshold
2. **Variance**: Can lose 5-10 bets in a row by chance
3. **Market evolution**: Vegas could catch on and adjust
4. **Sample size**: 306 bets is good but not definitive

---

## Bet Sizing Guidelines (Phase 2 Only - After Week 4 Validation)

### Conservative (Recommended)
- **Weeks 5-8**: 0.5% of bankroll per bet
- **Weeks 9-12**: 0.75% if profitable
- **Weeks 13+**: 1.0% if consistently profitable

### Example with $10,000 Bankroll
- Weeks 5-8: $50/bet
- Weeks 9-12: $75/bet (if up)
- Weeks 13+: $100/bet (if still up)

### Never:
- ❌ Bet more than 2% of bankroll on single bet
- ❌ Chase losses by increasing bet size
- ❌ Ignore stop-loss triggers
